Yesterday I gave a talk at the [math department in Lund](https://www.maths.lu.se/english/) titled **A brief history of geometric mechanics**.

***

To talk on the history of such an extremely vast field means, of course, you have to make choices; I had to leave out many principal contributors (otherwise it would be dull: a long list of scientists, each one's work summarized in a sentence).

The story I told began in 1609, when Johannes Kepler published [*Astronomia nova*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomia_nova), and ended in 1966, when Vladimir Arnold showed that Euler's equations of hydrodynamics describe geodesics on a group of diffeomorphisms.
In-between I had Newton, Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton, Lie, Poincar√©, and Noether.
The slides are [available here](/assets/pdf/modin-geometric-mechanics-lund-2023.pdf).
