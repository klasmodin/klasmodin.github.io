For the new webpage I'm using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

***

My [old webpage](https://klasmodin.wordpress.com) is hosted on [WordPress.com](https://www.wordpress.com) which has served me well for many years. But now I have decided to move to the [Jekyll/GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) server-free, static site solution. I've experienced an increasing amount of ads on WordPress.com, which is annoying.
However, the main reason for the switch is Jekyll's excellent support for research oriented webpages, such as [`jekyll-scholar`](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) with support for bib-files, but in particular its support for [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

I hope the new webpage shall be of interest, whether you're a math-geek or not. :smile:
