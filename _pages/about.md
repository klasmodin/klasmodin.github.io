Welcome to my webpage! :sun_with_face:

I'm [Professor of Mathematics](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/moklas/) at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se) and the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se). I have a broad research interest, but my core knowledge lies within differential geometry, Hamiltonian mechanics, hydrodynamics, and computational mathematics.


<!-- I have a broad research interest, stretching from Hamiltonian PDE, geometric hydrodynamics, and shape analysis, to medical imaging, and mathematical foundations of deep learning; my core knowledge is the combination of differential geometry and computational mathematics. -->

On this page you’ll find information about my research, upcoming events, remarks, publications, presentation slides, contact links, etc.
