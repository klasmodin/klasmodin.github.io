Welcome to my new webpage! :sun_with_face: (eventually it will replace the [old one](https://klasmodin.wordpress.com))

I am [Professor of Mathematics](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Staff/Pages/klas-modin.aspx) at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se) and the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se) in Sweden. I have a broad research interest, stretching from Hamiltonian PDE, geometric hydrodynamics, and shape analysis, to medical imaging, and mathematical foundations of deep learning; my core knowledge is the combination of differential geometry and computational mathematics.

On this page you’ll find information about my research, upcoming events, remarks, publications, presentation slides, contact links, etc.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
