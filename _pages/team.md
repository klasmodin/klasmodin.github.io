Mathematical research entails both individual and collaborative work.
I enjoy a large network of collaborators:
36 co-authors from 23 universities in 9 countries so far (see [publications](/publications)).

## research team

At our Department we have a **Geometry and Numerics** team.
In addition to myself, the current members are:

- [Eugen Bronasco](https://www.gu.se/om-universitetet/hitta-person/eugenbronasco) (**Post-Doc**, since 2025) is working on backward error analysis within matrix hydrodynamics.

- [Sagy Ephrati](https://www.chalmers.se/personer/sagy/) (**Post-Doc**, since 2023) is working on geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD), with an emphasis on methods from matrix hydrodynamics and stochastics.

- [Michael Roop](https://www.chalmers.se/personer/mikhail) (**PhD student**, since 2021) is working with Zeitlin's model of 2-D hydrodynamics. The aim is to extend the approach, including the accompanying time discretization, to magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) and other fluid models from physics.
  In February 2024 he defended his licentiate thesis titled [Geometric discretization for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics on the sphere](https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/538944).

## previous members

- [Erik Jansson](https://research.chalmers.se/person/erikjans) (**PhD student**, 2020–2025) worked on geometric hydrodynamics and deep learning in a project supported by the [WASP program](https://wasp-sweden.org/research/).
  In May 2025 he defended his thesis titled [Geometric Numerical Methods: From Random Fields to Shape Matching](https://research.chalmers.se/publication/545974). He is doing a post-doc at the University of Cambridge.

- [Théo Dumont](https://theodumont.github.io/) (**Internship**, summer 2023) visited us from École des Mines de Paris to work on gradient flow problems residing in the connection between optimal transport and geometric hydrodynamics. He is currently a PhD student in optimal transport at the Université Gustave Eiffel.

- [Milo Viviani](https://miloviviani.wordpress.com/) (**PhD student**, 2015–2020) defended his thesis [Symplectic methods for isospectral flows and 2D ideal hydrodynamics](https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/517205) in June 2020. For it he recieved the SciCADE [New Talent Award](https://scicade2019.uibk.ac.at/index.php/new-talent-award). He is currently Assistant Professor at [Scuola Normale Superiore](http://www.crm.sns.it/) in Pisa, Italy.

- [Geir Bogfjellmo](https://www.nmbu.no/emp/geir.bogfjellmo) (**Post-Doc**, 2015–2017) worked on the construction and analysis of splines on symmetric spaces. He is currently Associate Professor at the [Norwegian University of Life Sciences](https://www.nmbu.no/).
