Mathematical research entails both individual and collaborative work.
I enjoy a large network of collaborators:
36 co-authors from 23 universities in 9 countries so far (see [publications](/publications)).

## research team

At our Department we have a **Geometry and Numerics** team.
In addition to myself, the current members are:

- [Sagy Ephrati](https://www.chalmers.se/personer/sagy/) (**Post-Doc**, since 2023) is working on geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD), with an emphasis on methods from matrix hydrodynamics and stochastics.

- [Michael Roop](https://www.chalmers.se/personer/mikhail) (**PhD student**, since 2021) is working with Zeitlin's model of 2-D hydrodynamics. The aim is to extend the approach, including the accompanying time discretization, to magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) and other fluid models from physics.
In February 2024 he defended his licentiate thesis titled [Geometric discretization for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics on the sphere](https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/538944).

- [Erik Jansson](https://research.chalmers.se/person/erikjans) (**PhD student**, since 2020) is working on connections between geometric hydrodynamics and residual neural networks in a project supported by the [WASP program](https://wasp-sweden.org/research/). 
In January 2023 he defended his licentiate thesis titled [Geometric discretization in shape analysis](https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/533880).

## previous members

- [Théo Dumont](https://theodumont.github.io/) (**Internship**, summer 2023) visited us from École des Mines de Paris to work on gradient flow problems residing in the connection between optimal transport and geometric hydrodynamics.

- [Milo Viviani](https://miloviviani.wordpress.com/) (**PhD student**, 2015–2020) defended his thesis [Symplectic methods for isospectral flows and 2D ideal hydrodynamics](https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/517205) in June 2020. For it he recieved the SciCADE [New Talent Award](https://scicade2019.uibk.ac.at/index.php/new-talent-award). He is currently pursuing a post-doc at [Scuola Normale Superiore](http://www.crm.sns.it/) in Pisa, Italy.

- [Geir Bogfjellmo](https://www.nmbu.no/emp/geir.bogfjellmo) (**Post-Doc**, 2015–2017) worked on the construction and analysis of splines on symmetric spaces. He is currently Associate Professor at the [Norwegian University of Life Sciences](https://www.nmbu.no/).
