The discourse is captured in the following question: How can reversible dynamics give rise to irreversible behavior? In this talk, I shall discuss how the same enigma shows up in a finite-dimensional model of the 2-D incompressible Euler equations. The model, suggested by V. Zeitlin in 1991, uses quantization theory to replace the vorticity formulation of the 2-D Euler equations by an isospectral flow of matrices. This way, a spatial discretization preserving all the geometric structure is obtained. Recent advances on Zeitlin's model propose a connection between the long-time behavior of (generic) 2-D Euler flows and integrability conditions for “blob dynamics.” A major point at issue, however, is whether simulations based on Zeitlin's model truly reflect the dynamics of 2-D Euler. It is within this context that the reversibility paradox enters. The work is joint with Milo Viviani.}

    abstract = {In 1991, Vladimir Zeitlin realized that quantization naturally leads to spatial discretizations of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations. Contrary to other discretizations, this approach - matrix hydrodynamics - preserves the rich geometry in phase space (Lie-Poisson structure, co-adjoint orbits, Casimirs, spatial symmetries, etcetera). Matrix hydrodynamics is therefore suitable for long-time computer simulations aiming to study statistical properties of generic solutions. In this talk, I shall give an overview of recent developments in matrix hydrodynamics while emphasizing its relevance to mixing.}

    abstract = {The study of diffeomorphism groups and their applications to problems in analysis and geometry has a long history. Geometric hydrodynamics, pioneered by V. Arnold in the 1960s, considers an ideal fluid flow as the geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of a flow domain in the energy metric. A similar consideration on the space of densities led to a geometric description of the optimal mass transport and the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. Likewise, the information geometry associated with the Fisher-Rao metric and Hellinger distance has an equally beautiful infinite-dimensional geometry and can be regarded as a higher Sobolev analogue of optimal transportation. In this mini-course, I shall describe various Riemannian metrics on diffeomorphism groups and describe the connection to information geometry. The material is based on a forthcoming essay with B. Khesin and G. Misiolek, which shall make up the course literature.}

    abstract = {In a 1949 paper, the Norwegian American genius Lars Onsager demonstrated that Boltzmann’s theory of statistical mechanics provides insights to the long-time behavior of 2-D fluids described by Euler's equations. The key notion is to “approximate” the fluid by a finite number of interacting point vortices. Since these are governed by Hamiltonian dynamics, the framework of statistical mechanics provides a characterization of the long-time asymptotic behavior. The approach successfully predicts clustering of equally signed vortices, which is part of Onsager’s legacy. Nevertheless, and as Onsager proclaimed in his paper, the point vortex approximation is highly non-regular and might therefore be poor. Furthermore, statistical mechanics assumes ergodicity, which fails for 2-D Euler. In this talk, I will present another finite-dimensional approximation of 2-D Euler due to Vladimir Zeitlin. Unlike point vortices, Zeitlin’s model gives smooth approximations. It thereby renders a refinement of Onsager’s statistical approach, and, together with a symplectic numerical time-integration scheme, provides a structure preserving numerical method. Simulations using this method suggest compelling connections between 2-D Euler and integrability of low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems with symmetry. The work is joint with Milo Viviani.}

This finite dimensional model takes the form of an isospectral flow of matrices. It is the only known discretization that preserves the Lie–Poisson structure, i.e., the Hamiltonian structure associated with geodesic flows on Lie groups equipped with a right invariant Riemannian metric—the 1966 discovery of Arnold. Despite over three decades in presence, Zeitlin’s model is surprisingly underexplored. In the last couple of years, however, this beautiful approach has seen something of a renaissance, with several new developments, and applications to geophysical flows (quasi-geostrophic equations) as well as incompressible 2-D magnetohydrodynamics. In this talk, I wish to present some insights gained during these developments, particularly those related to the long-time behavior of 2-D Euler—the long-standing problem described as the “jewel of 2-D turbulence”. This is a joint work with Milo Viviani (Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy).}

After presenting these results, I was asked an insightful question: The phase space underlying the numerical model in the simulations is compact. Because the dynamics is also Hamiltonian, we have Poincaré recurrence. But the dynamics in the simulations, leading to blob formations, seem contractive. Isn't the mechanism for blob formations instead induced by fictitious dissipation, introduced via the numerical time discretization? I didn’t have a good answer at the time, but the question stayed with me. Today I have an answer, which is the subject of this talk.}

    abstract = {The 2-D Euler equations of a perfect fluid possess a beautiful geometric description: they are reduced geodesic equations on the infinite-dimensional Lie group of symplectomorphims with respect to a right-invariant Riemannian metric. This structure enables insights to Eulerian and Lagrangian stability via sectional curvature and Jacobi equations. The Zeitlin model is a finite-dimensional analog of the 2-D Euler equations; the only known discretization that preserves the rich geometric structure. Theoretical and numerical studies indicate that Zeitlin's model provides consistent long-time behaviour on large scales, but to which extent it truly reflects the Euler equations is mainly open. Towards progress, I present here two new results. First, convergence of the sectional curvature in the Euler--Zeitlin equations on the Lie algebra su(N) to that of the Euler equations on the sphere. Second, L2-convergence of the corresponding Jacobi equations for Lagrangian and Eulerian stability. The new results allow geometric conclusions about Zeitlin's model to be transferred to Euler's equations and vice versa. Joint work with Manolis Perrot (Univ. Grenoble Alpes, France).}
